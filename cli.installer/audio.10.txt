Now, After a while, once our wallets are fully synchronized, we would need at least two valid addresses for trading, one Blocknet and one Litecoin address.
      One important thing to remind is that dex-bot requires separate coin address per trading strategy, so the running bot instance with strategy uses funds on specific address only, other addresses funds are not touch. It is mandatory to use one address per one trading strategy.
      
      New addresses can be generated easy by graphical user interface wallet in section receive, set some label and push request payment button. But now we show how to generate new address by build-in console interface by simple command get-new-address dot default, we confirm commands by enter key, we fill address name and again confirm by enter key to finally get brand new address where funds could be stored for our Blocknet and Litecoin trading strategy.

      Next open also Litecoin wallet console interface to generate address as well Lets enter get-new-address dot default command also here. Enter key to confirm. Set label and Enter key to confirm again. Sometimes it could take a little seconds for address to be generated.
