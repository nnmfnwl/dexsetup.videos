Now we use second command to anonymously download dexsetup installer itself from github and start it.

It is very small script, the download could take just a few seconds and right after it interactively guides you which components of decentralized exchange to install and configure.

But even if you answer yes to install and configure all components, it doesn't matter, because you can always run only those components which you need at time.

Also at any time you can run installer again to install, update or reconfigure just specific needed components.

Every possible interactive question have two specific arguments which could be used to skip installer interactivity and use it in automatization deployment scripts.

So do we accept MIT license agreement and want to continue with this installer, yes.

Would we like to update operating system before installation start. yes.

Would we like to install tor and related privacy packages. yes.

We also answer yes to all other three related command line interface and graphical user interface packages and tools which could be useful later as well.

Also we want to control our remote server not only by console but also by VNC over SSH tunnel connection, so we set to configure VNC server with our user profile on server.

Now above we can see which command for system upgrade will be executed.

Command ask for root or sudo password depending on system administration management configuration.

As VNC session configured for our user would not be functional without VNC login password. We must configure it first.

We set first password but view only password we not need.

Now installer downloads dexsetup framework itself.

Optimized mate desktop configuration would be very usefull also on fast local connections because it saves lot of traffic which could be problematic even over local wireless connection.

Now we have to choose which wallet to install.

With just one exception of PIVX wallet all will be downloaded and build from source code.

This Step could take lot of time so video would be skip few times.

Every wallet build or download process let us know if finished success.
