Now, return back and lets take a look what could be found for example in Blocknet wallet directory.
  First is binary files directory where command line wallet interface, wallet daemon and graphical user interface wallet are.
  Next is that every wallet profile has own CLI directory where very useful predefined auto-complete commands are stored.
  There is also git source directory, where wallet source code been downloaded and compiled.
  There is also package directory used if wallet is downloaded and extracted as binary package.

  Next we could see two profile files used to enter secure development environment.
  And all other files are generated DAO wallet profile, decentralized exchange wallet profile, and staking wallet profile.

Next, in main directory we could find a dex-bot a decentralized exchange bot directory with all generated trading strategies scripts.
   And there in git source code directory, could be found strategies configuration files itself.

Next, in main directory we could find main dex-setup framework directory which contains all needed scripts for manual component customization and management.
Usually users who not need special custom profiles will never touch dex-setup framework itself rather running dex-setup command line installer repeatedly.

Next, in main directory we could find Block-DX, decentralized exchange graphical user interface.

As mostly all basics been explained, lets initiate our decentralized exchange instance for the first time.
   Instead of starting components manually one by one by mouse click or commands in terminal, the dex-setup generates for us terminal screen multiplexer start and stop script which biggest advantage is that all components becomes manageable very comfortable also by command line interface.

So we can double click this graphical user interface start script, but rather we switch back to dex-setup installer readme page,
   we switch to section four, called Start, Attach, Navigate and Detach from installed dexsetup environment by terminal.
   We find and copy second command used to start environment with graphical user interface mode support as well, then switch back to VNC client, open terminal for example by keyboard shortcut, Windows, T, and paste start command in.
   
While this command take few seconds to process, we switch back to dex-setup installer page to read and learn very important basic commands and shortcuts like.
   How to attach to service command line interface management by command, screen, minus, X.
   How to list and navigate screen tabs with shortcut, Control, A, double quotes.
   And also how to detach from while keep all components running in background by shortcut, Control, A, D. 

Now, we can switch back to terminal inside VNC client and use screen, minus, X, command to attach to decentralized exchange command line service. At same time we can switch back to server terminal over SSH connection. And use same screen, minus, X command to attach to service without graphical user interface. Very slow internet connection could be the useful case when we want to manage decentralized exchange service just by terminal without remote desktop.

Now, we can switch back to terminal inside VNC client and use screen, minus, X, command to attach to decentralized exchange command line service. In case of very slow internet connection it could be useful to manage decentralized exchange service same just by terminal without remote desktop.
   
   So, now we use mentioned keyboard shortcut Control, A, double quote, to navigate components and choose which we want to start.
   
   For example, we would like to use dex-setup for Pivx staking, so we choose Pivx staking component and just confirm predefined command to start Pivx staking wallet. It seems that native Pivx wallet is started, but literally everything is running isolated inside system and network sandbox by firejail and tor.
   
   Now we also switch to Pivx CLI component. Where if we enter dot, slash and then push tab key, it provides lot of predefined commands which are generated by dex-setup, new could be easy added later, so whole community will benefits from it.
   
   For now we not need this Pivx component running, so we use dot, slash, stop command to make it exit.
   
Next, we go back to dex-setup installer page, and switch to section five, which guides us how to use dex-bot trading strategy-one generated by installer with Blocknet and Litecoin trading pair.
   
   We just follow the instruction, no copy commands needed, because start script already made everything ready for usage.
   We switch back to VNC client, in terminal switch to Blocknet decentralized exchange component, as you can see here is already predefined command, just enter key is needed.
   Then we switch terminal to Litecoin decentralized exchange component and same as before, just confirmation with enter key is needed.
