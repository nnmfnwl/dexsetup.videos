After our wallet confirms transaction, we switch CLI interface back to trading bot and we can start strategy with parameter minus minus reset,
   because funds on addresses been changed manually.
   
   Now We can watch dex-bot output what is happening.
   We also open Block-DX and check whats happening there.
   As you can see bot is creating orders and doing stuff according our configuration.
   
   We can call this mission accomplished, but wait!
   
   Never forget to clean up opened orders after finishing with bot.
   So we push Control Z to stop our trading bot strategy script.
   And we start bot again with minus minus cancel-address parameter and watch if our bot has some orders to clean up.
   
   Thats finally all folks.
   Thanks for watching, thanks for likes, thanks for sharing and most thanks for using.
