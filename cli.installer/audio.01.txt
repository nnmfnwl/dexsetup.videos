Hi everyone.

In this video tutorial we gonna show you how to setup backend of one of the kind truly fully decentralized peer to peer crypto currency exchange system based on Blocknet interchain service node system named BlockDX.

Due to the number of components and configuration files that make up this system, it was necessary to create a DEXSETUP security setup that takes care of everything with best practices and also securely isolate each component from both user data and the components themselves.

It is important for every backend system operator to be able to configure whole system in own specific way and also to manage or update specific components one by one.

To give you a better idea, here is a list of all technologies and components used by this amazing decentralized exchange system:
The Debian GNU Linux operating system.
The Firejail advanced native kernel isolation sandbox technology.
The Tor multi-hop routing privacy internet layer.
The Proxychains tor sandbox layer.
The GNU Screen terminal multiplexer.
The Tiger VNC remote desktop server.
The Blocknet fully decentralized interchain service node communication system.
The Blocknet Xbridge the main API of decentralized exchange system.
The DEXBOT decentralized exchange automatic trading bot and DEXSETUP trading strategy templates
The BlockDX graphical user interface app for trading.
The core node wallets of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Verge, PIVX, DASH, Lbry Credits, Pocketcoin and Particl.
The Tor Browser total privacy web browser by tor.
And the Session privacy messaging app.

Now back from theory into practice.

As the most easy to use endpoint to configure base of this amazing system is dexsetup installer which is exactly topic of this tutorial.

Target server machine could be local or remote Debian Linux accessible by SSH connection.

Most easy way is to use main web page of dexsetup command line interface installer.

Scrolls down little bit page to see, how setup dexsetup with cli installer.

There are offered two ways to start installer, si we choose second options which is private and anonymous.

There first command... TODO
