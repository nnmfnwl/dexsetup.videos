Next is to configure Dex-Bot the decentralized exchange automatic liquidity and trading bot.

Dex-setup installer contains predefined trading strategy configurations which are merged on predefined dex-bot default template and this way it generates trading strategy configurations and start scripts. All trading pairs are for now configured by default with Litecoin.

As you can see, if installer finds out that dex-bot strategy already exists, it offers us to update it according to latest predefined configuration.
Now you have to think twice before answering. If you already customized your trading strategies according your specific requirements, it would be better to answer no, because all your custom configuration changes would be lost. But also if you do not like your own custom trading strategy changes and you can not remember changes you did, it would be good idea to reset all strategy configuration by answering yes.

This process could take some few seconds, as it is searching for all wallets configuration files to update it according to blocknet decentralized exchange system compatibility.

Remember this is just very basic automatic trading bot configuration. It is advanced and tested but still considered experimental, so it is recommended to use just very small amounts of coins to test first. Expected is that over time we will make many custom different trading strategy configurations per trading pairs based on market conditions. For cases like when trading pair gets volatile, for bear market, for bull market, for long term downtrend, so we choose strategy depending on use-case, if providing just liquidity to start our business or we are willing to profit or even exit market fast.
