Now we are almost ready to start our automatic liquidity and trading bot for the first time.

At first be sure both traded coins wallets are running, unlocked and fully synced.
    So we switch back to command line interface.
    We find and select Blocknet CLI component first.
    Now the command which could be used to check if our wallet is fully synced is get-block-chain-info dot basics.
    And to check if our wallet is unlocked and contains funds is get-wallet-info dot basic.
    As you can see our wallet is fully synced to last block.
    Also what you can see our wallet have funds and is unlocked or do not even contain unlock information because is not encrypted.
    
    After Blocknet We have to do same checks with Litecoin wallet.
    
    Obviously we can make this checks just by one second look at graphical user interfaces of our wallets.
