Next step is to setup custom wallet profiles which are having separated chain data directories, so we will be able to run them at same time with other wallets used for decentralized exchange trading.

For example we can choose to also configure standalone blocknet wallet for DAO the decentralized autonomous organization, the governance wallet.

Installer also have predefined to ask to setup standalone staking profiles for blocknet, pocketcoin and PIVX.

We also choose to configure all wallet profiles for decentralized exchange trading.

So it configures blocknet, litecoin, bitcoin, verge, dogecoin, pivx, dash, libry, pocketcoin and particl wallet nodes.

This process could take some few seconds, as it is analyzing all wallets configuration files to update it according to blocknet decentralized exchange system compatibility.
