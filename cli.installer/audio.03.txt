Next step is to setup custom wallet profiles which could have even separated chain data directory, so user will be able to run them at same time as other wallet used for decentralized exchange trading.
  One important thing to remind is that dex-setup and dex-bot requires to configure unique coin address per trading strategy, so the running bot instances are using funds from specific address only.

For example we can choose to also configure standalone blocknet wallet for DAO the decentralized autonomous organization, the governance wallet.

Installer also have predefined to setup standalone staking profiles for blocknet, pocketcoin and PIVX.

We also choose to configure all wallet profiles for decentralized exchange trading.

So it configures blocknet, litecoin, bitcoin, verge, dogecoin, pivx, dash, libry, pocketcoin and particl wallet nodes.

This process could take some few seconds, as it is analyzing all wallets configuration files to update it according to blocknet decentralized exchange system compatibility.
