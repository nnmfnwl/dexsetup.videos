Would we like to auto-configure tor-browser default profile. If we previous step installed tor-browser it is recommended to configure or reconfigure default profile.

Process of generating default tor-browser profile could take few seconds depending on machine storage speed.

Now, as all selected components been installed and configured and dex-setup installer has successfully finished, we return back to dex-setup installer page and continue according to instructions about to open secure SSH tunnel for VNC connection and use VNC client Remmina to connect to our newly setup server.

At first we copy command used to open SSH tunnel with server. We open terminal with new tab. We paste command but before confirmation, we update it according our server IP address.

Then we return back to dex-setup installer page and copy command used to remote view and manage server desktop by Remmina VNC client.
This is just easy to use command for Linux users, but you are free to use any VNC client as well.

Authorization to remote VNC remote desktop requires password we set in the beginning of installation.

At first we can use keyboard shortcut Windows plus G to take a look at newly created dex-setup directory structure and components included.

So lets take a look what we could find in dex-setup root directory.

AS you can see, all components having separated directory.

In contrast with other systems architectures which are using virtualization, containers, docker or whatsoever, all dex-setup components are existing as main file-system directories configured to look like running on native operating system environment, but at same time isolated by native kernel features by firejail custom profiles and also network isolation by tor by proxy-chains. It means every running component can not see other user files or other components files, for example running Bitcoin wallet component can see chain directory which is by default dot bit-coin and read-only executable bit-coin wallet binary file.
