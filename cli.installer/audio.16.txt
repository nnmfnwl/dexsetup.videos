After funds been delivered and confirmed, we need to split our funds because every order needs own UTXO the unspent transaction output.
   The most effective is to use specialized Blocknet commands to split funds into correct size.
   The DX Split Address command, with first parameter token ticker, which is BLOCK,
           second parameter is split amount, so as we have hundred Blocknet coins, and we are creating four orders at maximum size of ten,
               so we could split out funds by twenty, which will make five unspend transaction outputs,
           last mandatory parameter is address, which is address where funds are already sitting.
   Now we have to wait until at least one confirmation of our funds split transaction.
